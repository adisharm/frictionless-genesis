# **Why is Adobe increasing prices?**

Since launching Creative Cloud more than five years ago, we have not changed prices for customers in North America. As Creative Cloud continues to evolve and we enter a new phase in our product offering, we will be raising prices for the first time on March 5, 2018. For our All Apps plans customers, we recently released five all-new apps in Creative Cloud â€“ Adobe XD CC, Dimension CC, Character Animator CC, Lightroom CC and Spark with premium features. Single App customers also benefited from the ongoing development of new features and performance improvements, along with the addition of Spark with premium features to their plans. We also introduced a redesigned admin console experience for Creative Cloud for teams and Creative Cloud for enterprise administrators. The MAX 2017 release greatly expands on the promise of continued innovation with an extra focus on new tools and features that businesses highly value, including:

- High impact campaigns and experiences across multiple screens: XD is the first all-in-one tool for UX designers to build web and mobile apps, allowing a creative pro to design, prototype, review, share and receive feedback from stakeholders in the app itself.
- Brand identity: Adobe Dimension helps designers create photorealistic product shots, packaging and more without requiring companies to incur expensive photo shoot costs or require designers learn hard to use 3D solutions. 3D made easy for designers who know 2D
- Reach influencers via social platforms: Adobe Spark allows creators to rapidly create and deliver brand campaigns on social media with video, graphics and web pages.
- Integrations between Creative Cloud and Adobe Experience Manager that unify the creative and marketing workflow, thereby addressing content velocity pain points

# What percentage will prices increase by?

Price increases will vary by plan. Individuals and Teams who purchase via Adobe.com will be notified by email of their specific price change. Others should contact their Adobe Certified Partner Account Manager.

# When will prices increase?

The increased prices will be effective for new, add-on, and renewal purchases starting on March 5, 2018.

# Will the price increase affect all plans?

No. The change affects North America customers on Creative Cloud for individuals, Creative Cloud for teams, and Creative Cloud for enterprise Single App and All Apps plans only.

Non-profits and educational institutions that purchased through a Value Incentive Plan (VIP) or Enterprise Term License Agreement (ETLA) will not be impacted by the [price increase.](https://helpx.adobe.com/support.html)

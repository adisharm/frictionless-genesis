## Data collection[](https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/Mobile/basics.html#data-collection "Permalink to this headline")

A data logging mechanism enables Adobe to collect a small amount of data that can help improve the product. All data is combined across users and devices, and there is no way Adobe can identify a specific device or user from which this information is collected. This data does not include any private data or personally identifiable information.

Note

Users always have complete flexibility to opt-out of Adobe’s analytics collection at any point. On opt-out, the product immediately stops sending any data back to Adobe’s servers. A user can always decide to opt-in at a later point.
